# Operation Freakout: A Covert Plan by the Church of Scientology

## üóíÔ∏è Answer

Operation Freakout, also known as Operation PC Freakout, was a covert plan orchestrated by the Church of Scientology with the intent to discredit and harass Paulette Cooper, a U.S. author and journalist critical of the Church. The operation aimed to have her imprisoned or committed to a mental institution.

The plot was revealed through internal church documents and court transcripts. Dated April 1, 1976, these documents detailed the sinister plan directed at Paulette Cooper. The Church sought to frame her for bomb threats, continuing a pattern of harassment against the journalist.

Operation Freakout was part of a larger campaign against Paulette Cooper, who had previously written a book critical of Scientology. The church aimed to silence and intimidate her through various means, including legal actions and false accusations.

Despite the Church's efforts, the truth about Operation Freakout came to light. The plan involved framing Cooper for bomb threats, a tactic aligned with the Church's history of aggressive actions against perceived enemies. The Church's internal documents outlining Operation Freakout became crucial evidence in exposing Scientology's abusive practices.

Paulette Cooper endured years of harassment, and a grand jury investigation into her case was hindered by the Church's non-cooperation. However, the revelations about Operation Freakout contributed to public awareness of Scientology's extreme measures to suppress dissent and criticism.
