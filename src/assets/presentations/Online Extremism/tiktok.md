Examining Online Radicalization and Recruitment: Online Propaganda and Radicalization

One of the primary ways in which online extremism manifests is through the dissemination of extremist propaganda. Extremist groups create and share content that promotes their ideologies, glorifies violence, and demonizes those who oppose them. This content can take various forms, including videos, images, written articles, and social media posts. These materials are designed to attract individuals who may be susceptible to radicalization.
