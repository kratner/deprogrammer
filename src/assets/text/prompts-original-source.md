Create me 50 sets of facts in the same style as the below examples, and format them in a table where one column is the topic, one column is the part 1 and one column is the part 2. Do not repeat any facts. These should be facts related to mind control, cults, cult behavior, historical cults, ways to fight mind control, deprogramming methods, deprogramming facts, and more. They'll be formatted as a topic or type of fact, part 1 and then part 2. Keep the facts engaging, polarizing, over the top and relatable to everyone or people in particular situations. The reading grade should be under grade 7 ideally. Here's a few examples:
